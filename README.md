## Hello! I'm Preston Swincher (he/him), full stack engineer whose past lives include restauranteur, keynote speaker, and story coordinator.

I got into software development when I wanted better data to manage my small business; I taught myself javascript and RESTful APIs to pull data together and tell the story of our path to profitability. I built tons of tools to increase to help my team focus on the parts of their jobs they love, rather than admin work:
* time card and tip sheet managers to calculate a more just tip model for service industry workers
* Twilio and slack integration to allow bar managers to communicate with sales reps via a single channel, rather than on disparate personal phones
* Menu Map manager to pull directly pull point of sale data to measure our actual COGS against our theoretical ideal COGS

I also was the founder and story coordinator of the largest, ongoing, weekly in-person D&D game in the world (that we know of). I built an extensive platform on an Airtable relational database to manage dozens of Dungeon Masters, hundreds of paid subscribers and an ever growing waitlist of players. To continue learning in the entertainment space, I also enjoy Game Jamming! I've worked in Unity and C# to make entertaining experiences while learning how to collaborate with other devs.

After pursuing a certificate in Data Analytics, I realized that I enjoyed making software as much as I enjoyed data driven decision making. I completed TripleTen's full stack web dev boot camp to shore up my skillset:
* HTML and CSS
* React.js
* Node.js and Express APIs
* MongoDB

I also have light experience/am learning:
* Typescript
* C#
* Unity
* AWS

Finally, I have strong professional experience in:
* Operations management
* Creative management
* Public speaking / presenting
* Storytelling and coaching

Past Projects:
* What to Wear (TripleTen, 2024)
* Game Library Manager (TripleTen Summit project, used today by a restaurant in Austin, TX)
* Battlemap Navigator

Ongoing Projects
* RPG Safety Toolkit
* My portfolio site!
